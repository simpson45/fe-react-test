Test React-Redux project for internal cources.

The idea is to create a single page application, which will allow users to search the Netflix
Roulette database.
There are two pages: main page with search and a page with a particular film.
 - Created a simple NodeJS server (using the Express).
 - Installed Webpack and Babel for application.
 - Pages layout using JSX. Components are decomposed into small reusable parts.
 - App link states between each other with React router.
 - Redux connected and all the data is in Redux store.
